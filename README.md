This project was a brain teaser exercize to allow me to think outside of the box. In this application, you will find a simple website that allows a user to generate a custom randomized password through prompt given through the website. After hitting the "generate" button, the user's custom password is shown on screen to make life easier.

I have attached the website's complete layout here to view before accessing the application:




Here is link to the deployed application: 




Thank you, and enjoy!
